    <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
    <P>This is a speculative design project that imagines what the historic Brooklyn neighborhood of
        Bedford-Stuyvestant, New York could look like in 100 years. Against the backdrop of gentrification today, this
        project is meant to inspire creative, participatory, and culturally-informed ideas about the types of spaces and
        services that residents can imagine, build, and demand to reflect the history and contributions of the
        neighborhood, while being responsive to environmental and demographic shifts.
    </P>

    <h1>ABOUT THE PROCESS</h1>
    <p> This site folks to imagine their own buildings for the neighborhood using AI. In an earlier version of this project,  prototypes of each structure were built using discarded 3D printed scraps (pictured in the bottom left or
        right of each poster). Leveraging neighborhood knowledge, lore, and research, each structure was assigned to a
        specific figure, cultural moment, or idea that resonated with the corresponding design. From there, a
        description was developed for each structure were created and shared with Gemini and/or Midjourney, along with
        the photo of the physical prototype and design inspiration from prominent Black artists, architects, and works,
        to develop a digital rendering. Finally photoshop was used to create each poster, which combines the prototype,
        rendering, and scouted photos of each location.

        This site allows anyone to contribute and share their ideas from anywhere. 
    </P>
