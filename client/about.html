        <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
        <p>This is a speculative design project that imagines what the historic Brooklyn neighborhood of
            Bedford-Stuyvesant, New York could look like in 100 years. Against the backdrop of gentrification today,
            this project is meant to inspire creative, participatory, and culturally-informed ideas about the types of
            spaces and services that residents can imagine, build, and demand to reflect the history and contributions
            of the neighborhood, while being responsive to environmental and demographic shifts.
        </p>

        <h1>ABOUT THE PROCESS</h1>
        <p>This site allows folks to imagine their own buildings for the neighborhood using AI. In an earlier version of
            this project, prototypes of each structure were built using discarded 3D printed scraps (pictured in the
            bottom left or right of each poster). Leveraging neighborhood knowledge, lore, and research, each structure
            was assigned to a specific figure, cultural moment, or idea that resonated with the corresponding design.
            From there, a description was developed for each structure and shared with Gemini and/or Midjourney, along
            with the photo of the physical prototype and design inspiration from prominent Black artists, architects,
            and works, to develop a digital rendering. Finally, Photoshop was used to create each poster, which combines
            the prototype, rendering, and scouted photos of each location.
        </p>
        <p>This site allows anyone to contribute and share their ideas from anywhere.</p>
